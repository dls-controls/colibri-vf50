# We need a number of tools to support upgrading:
#   fw_printenv, fw_setenv
#       Provided as part of U-boot, needed by upgrade process to update U-boot
#       environment for upgrade on reboot.
#   fw_env.config
#       Needed by fw_printenv and fw_setenv to locate U-boot environment.
#   getent
#       Used by upgrade-rootfs to convert server name to IP address, provided
#       as part of the toolchain system root.  This should probably be installed
#       as part of the overall rootfs installation.
#   upgrade-rootfs
#       This script is used to trigger an upgrade.
#   upgrade.config
#       This is used to define defaults for the upgrade process.
